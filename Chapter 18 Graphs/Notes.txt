Graphs Notes:
    - Informal Definition: a graph is a set of vertices and conntected by edges.
    - A directed graph is a set V of vertices and a set E in V x V edges.
    - Given an edge e = (u,v) u is its source and v is its sink
    - A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph in which there are no cycles ie paths which
        contain one or more edges and which begin and end at the same vertix

    - Bootcamp: 
        - Graphs are ideal for modeling and analyzing relationships between pairs of objects
            - Example:
                - suppose you were given a list of the outcomes of matches between pairs of teams
                  with each outcome being a win or loss.
                - Question Given a team A and B is there a sequence of matches such that each team beats the next
                    in the sequence
                - Model using a graph
                    - Teams are vertices
                    - Wins are edges
                - Both BFS and DFS would work
    
        - spatially connected object modeling
        - analyzing any binary relationships
        - DFS works well for looking for structures or connected components
        - Some problems related to optimization eg find shorts path from one vertex to another would
            work well with BFS and Dijkstras shortest path  and minimum spanning tree
        
        - BFS and DFS differ from eachother in terms of the additional information they provide
            - BFS
                - Can compute distances from the start vertex
            - DFS
                - can check if cycles are present
