Recursion Notes:
    - Applicable for searching, enumeration, divide and conquer, and decomposing complex problems

    - Consists of 
        - Base case
        - Recursive step

    - Bootcamp
        - Greatest comman diviser
            def gcd(x, y):
                return x if y == 0 else gcd(y, x%y)

    - Quick Notes
        - remove recursion the use the stack as a call stack structure
        - use recursion to avoid deeply nested loops
        - Recursion can be removed from a tail recursive program by using a while loop
        - If a recursive function will call the itself with the same arguments cache the results
