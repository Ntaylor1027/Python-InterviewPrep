Naive sort:
    - O(n^2)
    - Linear find then linear place

O(nlogn) Algorithms:
    - Definitions
        - stable: one where entries are equal appear in their original order
        - in-place: O(1) space

    -Types
        - heap sort
            - in place but not stable
        - merge sort
            - stable but not inplace
        - quick sort
            - runs O(n^2) worst case

Special Scenarios
    - short arrays < 10 insertion sort works best
    - if every element is known to be at most k places from its final location a minheap is best for 
        O(nlogk) sort
    - if there are a small number of distinct keys ie [0...255] then counting sort
        - Counting sort
            - records for each element the number of elemts less than it
            - keys are the numbers and values are their frequiences
