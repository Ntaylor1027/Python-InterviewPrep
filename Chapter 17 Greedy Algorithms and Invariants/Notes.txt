Greedy algorithms and Invariant notes
    - Greedy algorithms: an algorithm that computes solutions in steps,
        at each step the algorithm makes a decision that is localy optimum
    - Does not necessaryly perform optimum solutions
    - Example
        - British currency in coins: 30,24,12,6,3
        - Goal: make change using the smallest number of coins
        - Natural: Pick the largest coin and find coins for remainder
        - Issue: for 48 we would have chosen 30, 12, 6 but we could have done 24,24
    
    - Bootcamp:
        - often the right choice for optimization problems where theres a natural set of choices to select from
        - Conceptualize it recursively but implement iteratively
        - Sometimes the correct solution is not obvious
