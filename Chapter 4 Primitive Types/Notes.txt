Type: classification of data that spells out possible values for that type 
    and the operations that can be performed on it

In Python everything is an object

Primitive types bootcamp
    Different primitive types
        - numerics (integer)
        - sequences (list)
        - mappings (dict)
        - classes
        - instances
        - exceptions
    - All the above are objects
    
    Max int value can be denoted with sys.maxsize
    sys.maxsize is the systems word size specifically the maximum value of an integer

    Bounds on float are specified by sys.float_info

    Bitwise operations
        &
        |
        >>
        <<
        ~
        ^
        Negatives are twos complement

    Key methods for numerics
        math.ceil()
        math.floor()
        min(x,y)
        max(x,y)
        pow(x,exp)
        math.sqrt()
        inf (infinity)
    
    When comparing floats use math.isclose()

    Key methods in random
        random.randrange()
        random.randint()
        random.random()
        random.shuffle(A)
        random.choice(A)
